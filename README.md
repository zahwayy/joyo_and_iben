## 1. How to run
```python
python app.py
```
_* there will be an error occurs at the first time you run the application. This is because there are still some code missing, and it will be your task to fix all the missing code._

## 2. Safe and danger zone
- You can modify all files in `models` and `controllers` directory
- Do not change anything inside the `db` directory
- Do not change anything inside `utils.py`
- You may change something inside the `const.py` but just for your own experiment. There are nothing to do in it related to the assignment

## 3. What to do?
1. Find all of the `TODO` tag inside `controllers` and `models` directory
2. Identify the function for each part of the code, especially the block which have a `TODO` tag
3. Replace or remove the `TODO` tag after you sure that the code is already have the right functionality
4. Make sure to solve all the missing code so the program can run perfectly
